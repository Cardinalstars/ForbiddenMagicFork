ForbiddenMagic
==============

Forbidden Magic is a small Minecraft mod written as an add-on for the mod [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-).  It adds a few magical artifacts of a more sinister bent to the game as well as several interactions between Thaumcraft and other magic-themed mods such as [Botania](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1294116-botania-an-innovative-natural-magic-themed-tech) or [Ars Magica 2](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2028696-/).
